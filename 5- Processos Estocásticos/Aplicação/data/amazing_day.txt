We sat on a roof
Named every star
Shared every bruise and
Showed every scar

Hope has its proof
Put your hand in mine
Life has a beautiful, crazy design
And time seemed to say
Forget the world and its weight
Here I just wanna stay

Amazing day
Amazing day

We sat on a roof
Named every star and
You showed me a place
Where you can be what you are

And the view
The whole Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm drifting away
And in your arms
I just wanna sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
Can there be breaks
In the chaos sometimes?
Oh, thanks God
Must've heard when I prayed
Cause now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Today
