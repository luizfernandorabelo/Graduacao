I wanna know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends

(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)

Rosaleen of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the Moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon

She went, woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Indigo go up to heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She said

I wanna know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I wanna know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

He went, woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true, true, woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

Oh, I wanna know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I wanna know when I can go
Back and be young again
(Yeah)

Woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Cherub Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the Moon

I wanna know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I wanna know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo woo, woo woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
I wanna be with you till the world ends
I wanna be with you till the whole world ends

(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
(Boom boom ka, buba de ka)
(Boom)
