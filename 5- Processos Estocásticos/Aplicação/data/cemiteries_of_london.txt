At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they'd go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la la, la la la, la le
And the night over London lay

So we rode down to the river
Where Victoria's Ghost pray
For their curses to be broken
We go underneath the arches
Where the witches are in there saying
"There are ghost towns in the ocean"
The ocean

Singing la la, la la la, la le
And the night over London lay

God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart, it wasn't open
Not open

Singing la la, la la la, la le
And the night over London lay

Singing la la, la la la, la le
There's no light over London today
