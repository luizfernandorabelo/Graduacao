Today I heard the strangest
I heard the strangest song

A DJ a star away is
Playing it to turn us on

My heart started glowing
I feel it inside, it's flowing

I say I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah

Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Today I had the strangest
Feeling that I belong
Before, I was dying
I feel it inside, now I'm flying

I say I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed, yeah

Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But from another planet
Still they call us humankind

Before, I was dying
I feel it inside, now I'm flying

I know, I know, I know
We're only human
I know, I know, I know
How we're designed

Oh, I know, I know, I know
We're only human
But we're capable of kindness
So they call us humankind
