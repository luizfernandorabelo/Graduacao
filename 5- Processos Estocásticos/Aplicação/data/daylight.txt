To my surprise, my daylight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst, to show daylight

Ooh and the Sun shine, yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realise, who cannot live without
Who come apart without it

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn, child
And at full tilt, and at full flight
Defeat darkness, bring the daylight

Ooh and the Sun shine, yeah on this heart of mine
Ooh and I realise, who cannot live without
Who come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
Slowly breaking through the daylight
