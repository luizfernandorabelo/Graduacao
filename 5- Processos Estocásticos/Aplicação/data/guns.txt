Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums

The judgement of this court is
We need more guns

Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Meltdown all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
War is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your lookalikes, and fuck the other ones

It's the opinion of this board that
We need more guns

Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
