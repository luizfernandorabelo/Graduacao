Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river gonna flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eyes
I know I swear we'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold

Bullets fly split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes

Oh, oh, oh
