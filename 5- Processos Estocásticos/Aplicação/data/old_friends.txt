Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
He had my back
Once he really saved my life

Sometimes, I wanna call him
Say: Hey, let's stay up 'til morning

And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends

We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends

And there are no ends to old friends
Amen
