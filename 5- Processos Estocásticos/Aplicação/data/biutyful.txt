All I know is I love you so

I hope that you get everything you want in this biutyful life
Change for your pocket, someone for the night
I hope they name you a rocket and take you for a ride for free

And if they tell you you're nothing, maybe you'd explain
To me you're the summer Sun after the rain
And you were there when I needed
Something for the pain, you see

When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me

I'm nowhere else
I'm on top of the world, man
On top of the world
And it's so biutyful
And you're so biutyful

I hope that you get everything you want in this biutyful life
Watermelon Moon, so happy you're alive
And I feel like a river finally arrived at sea

'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me

I know I'll be on top of the world, man
On top of the world
And it's so biutyful
And you're so biutyful
And it's so biutyful

'Cause when you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me
When you love me, love me, love me

I know I'll be on top of the world, man
On top of the world
And it's so biutyful
And you're so biutyful
And it's so biutyful
And you're so biutyful
And it's so biutyful
