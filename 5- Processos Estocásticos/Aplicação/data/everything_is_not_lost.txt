When I'm counting up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

So if you ever feel on neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

'Cause if you ever feel on neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel on neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

And singing it out
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
So come on yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Come on yeah
And everything's not lost
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Come on yeah
Come on yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Come on yeah
Everything's not lost
Sing out yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Come on yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Sing out yeah
And everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong then I'm sorry
But don't let it stand in our way
Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things I shouldn't have done
But life is for living we all know
And I don't want to live it alone
Sing ah, ah, ah
Sing ah, ah, ah
And you sing ah, ah, ah
