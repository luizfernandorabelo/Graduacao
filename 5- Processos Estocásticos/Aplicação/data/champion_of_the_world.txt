I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel

This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still, this sign upon my headstone write
A champion of the world

I try my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocketship reversed

Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Til' I'm champion of the world

(When I sail)
And when I sail, I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail)
Knowing I might fail
But still, I am hoping for the best
(In my dreams)
And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colors and say
I wandered the whole wide world, but
Baby, you're the best

So, I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe

I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world
