Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change

Meet under Sun and
Meet me again, in the rain
In the rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the pain

So meet under blue skies
Meet me again, in the rain
In the rain
In the rain, the rain

Got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone
