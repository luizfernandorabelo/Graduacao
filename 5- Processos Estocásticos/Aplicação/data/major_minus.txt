They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
But they don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear those crocodiles ticking round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting, while my left eye's under the chairs

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh oooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
