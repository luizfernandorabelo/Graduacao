What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
And what can't I get through?
And for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I go to your church

When you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're riding a wave

'abi ya allah ya qadirun, limadha tarkatuni?
'abi ya allah ya qadir
huriyat ya allah
mahabat ya allah

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I worship in your church, baby, always
I worship in your church, all the seven days (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I praise and praise
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
