I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over
An ocean awaits for a storm
The Sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh oooh ooh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it's spin
But come on don't give up
Don't say we give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over
Before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
I know it's over
Icarus says to the Sun
The Sword sinks in
Lightning strikes
And two forces, two forces collide
And fight 'til it's over
Fight 'til it's done
Ah ah ah
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh oh

From the top of the world
The top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost
We would have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're stopping the world
Stopping in its tracks but
Nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over
Before you run
Oh, didn't we have fun?

Cause you and me, we were always meant to
Always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me, we were always meant to
Always meant to be
Hey-ey-ey-ey

Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh oh didn’t we have fun?
Wooh ooh ooh ooh oo ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh oh didn’t we have fun?

But then
Maybe we could again
