In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh, yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh, yeah

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

Yeah, how long must she wait for it?
Yeah, how long must she pay for it?
Yeah, how long must she wait for it?
For it, yeah

Sing it please, please, please
Come back and sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out, to me, me
Come back and sing it

In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
