'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you, ooh

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you, ooh
I think I see you, ooh

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)
