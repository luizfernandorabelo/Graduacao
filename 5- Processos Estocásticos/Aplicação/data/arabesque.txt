I could be you, you could be me
Two raindrops in the same sea
You could be me, I could be you
Two angles of the same view
And we share the same blood

Comme deux gouttes d’eau
On se ressemble
Comme provenant de la même mere
Comme deux ruisseaux (you could be me)
Qui se rassemblent (I could be you)
Pour faire les grandes rivières

And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

And we share the same blood
Yeah, we share the same blood

Music is the weapon
Music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon
Music is the weapon of the future
Music is the weapon
Music is the weapon of the future

Same fucking blood
Same fucking blood
