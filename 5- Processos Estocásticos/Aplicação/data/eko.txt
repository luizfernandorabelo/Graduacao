Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights
Corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrim's going nowhere
In millions of cars

Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
When there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say: It's alright, child
It's alright

In Africa
We dance in the water
And hold each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say: It's alright, child
It's alright

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride
