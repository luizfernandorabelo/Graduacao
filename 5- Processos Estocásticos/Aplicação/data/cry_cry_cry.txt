Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

In a book about the world
Called The Luminous Things
There are trees and flowers glowing
While trees are bold as ever seen

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

Don't want us to hurt each other
Or cause each other pain
Don't want to fear what we don't know
We're in this together, baby
We're as singing is to rain
So I'll never, ever, ever let you go

When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky
