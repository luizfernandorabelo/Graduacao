Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night
She'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night
Away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the Sun must set to rise

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
It could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
It could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
It could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
