If I lost a map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide

(Ooh)
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call
She said

When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never going to part

Come on, baby
Don't let it break your heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart
