When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows
Sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space, I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumbled upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?

You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

All this noise some waking up
All this space some taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Whoa

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

Swim out on a sea of faces
Tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need

See it in a new Sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me
