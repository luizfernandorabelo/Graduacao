Oh, oh

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Oh, oh

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire
A fire, a spark
Light a fire
A flame in my heart

We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
Oh, oh
We'll be glowing in the dark
Oh, whoa

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs

All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

Oh, oh (ah)

So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
