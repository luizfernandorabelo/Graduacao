Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I got to go, I got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart

Oh, whoa, oh, whoa
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Once upon a time, we burn bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight, on and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time, on the same side
Once upon a time, on the same side
In the same game

Now why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame?

I could've been the princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle, wore a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been the princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle, wore a ring
But no, you let me go

You stole my star
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

You stole my star
La la la la la la

Oh, whoa

'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me

'Cause you really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me, oh
'Cause you really hurt me, oh
You really hurt me
