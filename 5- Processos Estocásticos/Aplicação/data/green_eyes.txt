Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight
Shines upon you
And how could
Anybody
Deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I've met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on
Without you
Green eyes

Honey, you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

The green eyes
You're the one that
I wanted to find
Anyone who
Tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

'Cause I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Since I've met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes
Green eyes

Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
