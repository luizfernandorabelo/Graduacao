Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

Blood on the beat (oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Lore of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get relief

Trouble in town (oh-oh)
Because they hung my brother Brown
Because their system just keep you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, eh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is gettin' strained
