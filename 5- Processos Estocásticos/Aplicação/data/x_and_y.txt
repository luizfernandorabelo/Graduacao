Trying hard to speak
And fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan

When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I wanna love you but I don't know if I can

I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it anyway I can

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing

Oh, oh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space

You and me are floating on a tidal wave together
You and me are drifting into outer space and singing

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
