There's a wild wind blowing
Down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
As a cold war coming on the radio I heard
Baby, it's a violent world!

Oh, love, don't let me go!
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow?
I can hear it coming
I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh, and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Oh, love, don't let me go!
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow?
I can hear it coming
Like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity, release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground
