Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us
Is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out

Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the Moon
Know it's a slow burn

Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now

In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
All the satellites imbue

The purple, yellow, green
Red, orange and the blue
Oh it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you

Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through
