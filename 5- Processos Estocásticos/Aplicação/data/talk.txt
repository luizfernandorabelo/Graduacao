Oh, brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
â€˜Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So, you take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done
Do
Something that's never been done

So, you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk
