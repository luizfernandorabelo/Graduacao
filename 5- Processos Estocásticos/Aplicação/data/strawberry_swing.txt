They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking on the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold cold water
What you say?
When it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't want to change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away
When it's such, it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

Aah
Now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away
Oh, the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
