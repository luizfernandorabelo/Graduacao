Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time
It opened them up

And tonight rivers will run dry
And not for the first time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers
Looking for life on earth

Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards
But then
You'll go forwards
Again

You'll go backwards
But then
You'll go

Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it
Someone will mess it up

And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to one of us

You'll go backwards
But then
You'll go forwards
And then
You'll go backwards
Again
You'll go forwards

You'll go backwards
But then
You'll go forwards
Again

You'll go backwards
But then
You'll go forwards

Ah
