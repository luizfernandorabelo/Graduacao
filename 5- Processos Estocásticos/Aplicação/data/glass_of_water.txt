Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked
Will I see heaven in mine?

That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?

Oh oh oh oh I
Son don't ask
Neither how full or empty
Is your glass

Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Television selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align

Oh oh oh oh I
Son don't ask
Neither how full or empty
Is your glass

Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast

Oh what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water
