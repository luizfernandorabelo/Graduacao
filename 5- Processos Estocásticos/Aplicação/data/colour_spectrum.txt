This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes

As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house

Empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out
For some new delight

The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whatever comes
Because each has been sent
As a guide from beyond
