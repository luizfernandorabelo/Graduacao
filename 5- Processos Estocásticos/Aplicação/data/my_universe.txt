You (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I (I) just want (just want)
To put you first
And you (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I

In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes

Never-ending forever, baby

You (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I (I) just want (just want)
To put you first
And you (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And you make my world light up inside

And they said that we can't be together
Because, because we come from different sides

You (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I (I) just want (just want)
To put you first
And you (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (do, do, do, do)
My universe (do, do, do, do)
My universe (do, do, do, do)
(You make my world)
You make my world light up inside
(Make my world light up inside)

When I'm without you, I'm crazy
We are made of each other, baby

You (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I (I) just want (just want)
To put you first
And you (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (do, do, do, do)
My universe (do, do, do, do)
My universe (do, do, do, do)

You (you), you are (you are)
My universe
And I
(My universe)
