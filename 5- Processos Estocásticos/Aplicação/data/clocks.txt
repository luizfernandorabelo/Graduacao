Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

You are, you are
You are, you are

You are, you are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

You are, you are

Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go
Home, home where I wanted to go (you are)
Home, home where I wanted to go (you are)
